# SuRe-Thing
1. My team worked on this together
2. This includes all information about our work including the datasets used, data exploration, analysis used, link to our trello board can be found in the description.
3. Our dataset was from the US Department of Labor
4. We are analysing to see if any other national crises or events affect  unemployment as much as COVID-19 in 2020
5. 5. During our exploratory analysis we noticed that prior to the 1980s the average unemployment rate for women was always higher than the national seasonally adjusted average
6. However, since then, the unemployment rate for women has been just at par with or below the national average until 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
7. Women, were hit the hardest during the pandemic, going above the national average and the average for men.
8. This however was not the case during the economic recession, which was quite interesting.
9. During the recession, men were hit the hardest with the highest unemployment rate recorded in history.
10. Also unemployment rates were analysed for different demographics.
11. We however discovered that there were no demograohic records for black americans and the latino population until 1972 and 1973 respectively
12. And there were no records for Asians until the year 2000 although the available records date as far back as 1948
13. And unemployment rates for the White demographic was available as soon as 1954
